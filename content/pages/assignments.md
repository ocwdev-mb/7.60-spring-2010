Written Proposal
----------------

A written proposal is due at the end of the semester. The proposal will be a short (5 double-spaced pages or less, 12 pt Times), critical description of an experimental approach to address a topic covered in class.

An ideal proposal would briefly describe the experimental system and the issue to be addressed, outline a single experimental approach with appropriate controls to assess one aspect of this issue, describe possible outcomes and potential problems of the proposed experiment, and discuss conclusions that could be made based upon the possible outcomes.
